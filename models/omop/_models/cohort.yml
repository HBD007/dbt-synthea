    description: The subject of a cohort can have multiple, discrete records in thecohort table per cohort_definition_id,
      subject_id, and non-overlappingtime periods. The definition of the cohort is contained within theCOHORT_DEFINITION
      table. It is listed as part of the RESULTS schemabecause it is a table that users of the database
      as well as tools suchas ATLAS need to be able to write to. The CDM and Vocabulary tables areall
      read-only so it is suggested that the COHORT and COHORT_DEFINTIONtables are kept in a separate schema
      to alleviate confusion.
