    description: The COHORT_DEFINITION table contains records defining a Cohortderived from the data through
      the associated description and syntax andupon instantiation (execution of the algorithm) placed
      into the COHORTtable. Cohorts are a set of subjects that satisfy a given combination ofinclusion
      criteria for a duration of time. The COHORT_DEFINITION tableprovides a standardized structure for
      maintaining the rules governingthe inclusion of a subject into a cohort, and can store operationalprogramming
      code to instantiate the cohort within the OMOP Common DataModel.
