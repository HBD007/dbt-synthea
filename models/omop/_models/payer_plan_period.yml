    description: The PAYER_PLAN_PERIOD table captures details of the period of timethat a Person is continuously
      enrolled under a specific health Planbenefit structure from a given Payer. Each Person receiving
      healthcareis typically covered by a health benefit plan, which pays for (fully orpartially), or
      directly provides, the care. These benefit plans areprovided by payers, such as health insurances
      or state or governmentagencies. In each plan the details of the health benefits are definedfor the
      Person or her family, and the health benefit Plan might changeover time typically with increasing
      utilization (reaching certain costthresholds such as deductibles), plan availability and purchasingchoices
      of the Person. The unique combinations of Payer organizations,health benefit Plans and time periods
      in which they are valid for aPerson are recorded in this table.
