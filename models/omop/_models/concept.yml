    description: The Standardized Vocabularies contains records, or Concepts, thatuniquely identify each
      fundamental unit of meaning used to expressclinical information in all domain tables of the CDM.
      Concepts arederived from vocabularies, which represent clinical information across adomain (e.g. conditions,
      drugs, procedures) through the use of codes andassociated descriptions. Some Concepts are designated
      Standard Concepts,meaning these Concepts can be used as normative expressions of aclinical entity
      within the OMOP Common Data Model and standardizedanalytics. Each Standard Concept belongs to one
      Domain, which definesthe location where the Concept would be expected to occur within thedata tables
      of the CDM. Concepts can represent broad categories(‘Cardiovascular disease’), detailed clinical
      elements (‘Myocardialinfarction of the anterolateral wall’), or modifying characteristics andattributes
      that define Concepts at various levels of detail (severity ofa disease, associated morphology, etc.).
      Records in the StandardizedVocabularies tables are derived from national or internationalvocabularies
      such as SNOMED-CT, RxNorm, and LOINC, or custom OMOPConcepts defined to cover various aspects of
      observational dataanalysis.

        description: This flag determines where a Concept is a Standard Concept, i.e. is usedin the data,
          a Classification Concept, or a non-standard Source Concept.The allowable values are ‘S’ (Standard
          Concept) and ‘C’ (ClassificationConcept), otherwise the content is NULL.
