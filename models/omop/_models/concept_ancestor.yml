    description: The CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table is designed to simplify observationalanalysis by providing
      the complete hierarchical relationships betweenConcepts. Only direct parent-child relationships
      between Concepts arestored in the CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP table. To determine higher levelancestry
      connections, all individual direct relationships would have tobe navigated at analysis time. The
      CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table includesrecords for all parent-child relationships, as well asgrandparent-grandchild
      relationships and those of any other level oflineage. Using the CONCEPT_ANCESTOR table allows for
      querying for alldescendants of a hierarchical concept. For example, drug ingredients anddrug products
      are all descendants of a drug class ancestor.
    columns:
      - name: ancestor_concept_id
        description: The Concept Id for the higher-level concept that forms the ancestor inthe relationship.

      - name: min_levels_of_separation
        description: The minimum separation in number of levels of hierarchy between ancestorand descendant
          concepts. This is an attribute that is used to simplifyhierarchic analysis.

        description: The maximum separation in number of levels of hierarchy between ancestorand descendant
          concepts. This is an attribute that is used to simplifyhierarchic analysis.
